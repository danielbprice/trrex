This package contains a function for translating a 
trie into a regex.

Is based on the following resources:

- [Speed up regex](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42742810/speed-up-millions-of-regex-replacements-in-python-3)
- [Triegex](https://github.com/ZhukovAlexander/triegex) 


## Why trex?

Naming is difficult, but as we had to call it something:

* trex: **t**rie to **re**ge**x**
* trex: [Tyrannosaurus rex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus), a large dinosaur species with small arms  (rex meaning "king" in Latin)
